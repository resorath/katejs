<h1>Tell a Story</h1>

<p>You can write multiple lines of code. The code is used in order from top to bottom.</p>

<p>Write a <strong>three line story</strong> in the editor using <span class="code">print</span></p>

<p>Here is a two-line joke as an example, but make up your own story:</p>

<editor editor-id="story1" :content="lessonEditorPayloads.story1" disable noloadbutton autoheight></editor>

<p>Type your story of your choosing into the editor using <span class="code">print</span>, then press "Run".</p>


<script>
lessonEditorPayloads.story1 = "print(\"Why do cows wear bells?\");\nprint(\"Because their horns don't work\");";

var matchToAdvance = new RegExp(/[\S ]+\n[\S ]+\n[\S ]+/i);
var matchMode = "output"; // either editor or output
</script>
