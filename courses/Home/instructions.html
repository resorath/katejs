<h1>Welcome!</h1>

<p>Lets learn <strong>JavaScript</strong>!</p>

<p>You don't need to know any JavaScript, we will start from the beginning. First lets learn how to use this website.</p>

<p>You can try any code in the bottom left editor. Press the big green "Run" button to see the result in the bottom right.</p>

<p>Sometimes you will be given some code. You can copy code from the example area into the editor to try it. Don't forget to press run. Lets practice:</p>

<editor editor-id="home1" :content="lessonEditorPayloads.home1"></editor>

<p>Lets try some code that pops up a message. Copy this code by pressing the 'Copy into editor' button below it. Then press "Run":</p>

<editor editor-id="home2" :content="lessonEditorPayloads.home2"></editor>

<p>Your progress will be automatically saved at this computer. When your ready to move on, press Next.</p>

<button class="btnNext">Next</button>


<script>
lessonEditorPayloads.home1 = "\"Press 'Copy into editor' below me to copy me\"\n\"into the editor below.\"";
lessonEditorPayloads.home2 = "alert(\"This is an alert, press OK to continue\");";
</script>
