<h1>Strings</h1>

<p>Variables are important to master. You can't write a useful program without them.</p>

<p>Variables come in many different types. So far we have been using <em>Strings</em> with our variables.</p>

<p>A <em>String</em> is a bunch of letters, numbers, and symbols. They have no special meaning in JavaScript. These are all Strings, because we put them between double quotes:</p>

<ul>
	<li>"Kate"</li>
	<li>"The brown horse went to the stable."</li>
	<li>"37"</li>
</ul>

<p>You can put almost anything in between quotes. Lets look at a previous example:</p>

<editor editor-id="variablestwo1" :content="lessonEditorPayloads.variablestwo1"  disable noloadbutton autoheight></editor>


<p>If we said this line in English, we can pronounce it as:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 20px;">The variable myname is Kate.</p>

<p>We can also change the contents of a variable whenever we want, but we don't use <span class="code">var</span> when re-using a variable. Try out this example:</p>

<editor editor-id="variablestwo3" :content="lessonEditorPayloads.variablestwo3"></editor>

<p>Did you notice how lines 2 and 4 are the same, but printed different messages?</p>

<script>
lessonEditorPayloads.variablestwo1 = "var myname = \"Kate\";";
lessonEditorPayloads.variablestwo2 = "var myname = prompt(\"What is your name?\");";
lessonEditorPayloads.variablestwo3 = "var myname = \"Kate\";\nprint(\"My name is \" + myname);\nmyname = \"Thomas\";\nprint(\"My name is \" + myname);";

var matchToAdvance = new RegExp(/My name is Thomas/i);
var matchMode = "output"; // either editor or output
</script>
