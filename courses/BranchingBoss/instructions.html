<h1>Mini-Boss: Branching</h1>

<p>This test will see how good your knowledge of branching is.</p>

<p>Ask the user for a number, and then tell the user if their number is divisible by 2, 3, or 5 by printing one or more of the following:</p>

<p><strong>Your number is divisible by 2</strong></p>
<p><strong>Your number is divisible by 3</strong></p>
<p><strong>Your number is divisible by 5</strong></p>

<p><strong>Hint:</strong> The user's number can be divisible by more than one of the above numbers. </p>
<p><strong>Hint:</strong> Remember, the following modulus (remainder) operator can be useful to determine if one number is divisible by another:</p>

<editor editor-id="branchingboss1" :content="lessonEditorPayloads.branchingboss1" disable noloadbutton autoheight nowarn></editor>

<p>The result is "0", because 6 is divisible by 3 (and 6 &#247; 3 = 2, remainder 0).</p>

<p>Sample code has already been loaded for you. Good luck!</p>

<script>

lessonEditorPayloads.branchingboss1 = "6 % 3";

var matchMode = "callback"; // editor, output, or callback
var matchToAdvance = function() {

	if(typeof firstnumber != "number" || typeof secondnumber != "number")
		return false;

	var matchEditor = new RegExp(/var firstnumber[\S ]+\nvar secondnumber[\S ]+\n[\n[\S ]*print/i);
	if(matchEditor.test(editor.getValue()) && ($('#output').html().indexOf(String(firstnumber + secondnumber)) > -1) )
			return true;
	return false;
}
