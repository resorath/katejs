<h1>Looping Practice: Enforcing Inputs</h1>

<p>Another use for <span class="code">while</span> loops is to ask a user question with a limited set of answers. Remember that a <span class="code">while</span> loop works similar to an <span class="code">if</span> statement.</p>

<p>For example, it is reasonable that when we ask someone the year they were born, that they were born after the year 1900. If they enter a year before that, we will ask them again - and keep asking them until they give us an answer we expect.

<p class="exercise">Expand on the above code so that it prints out the factorial of a positive whole number that a user enters.</p>

<p><strong>Hint:</strong> Every time the loop runs, the value of counter is increased by one. You can use the counter to calculate the factorial.</p>
