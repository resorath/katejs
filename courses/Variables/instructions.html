<h1>Variables</h1>

<p>We can have the computer remember things for us, and then we can use it later. We do this with variables.</p>

<p>All variables have a name that we can give them, this is how we put things in and take things out. Here is some code that puts the name "Kate" into a variable called "myname". We then get the contents of the variable and print it to the screen.</p>

<editor editor-id="variables1" :content="lessonEditorPayloads.variables1"></editor>

<p>Press "Copy into editor", then "Run" to see what happens.</p>

<p>Notice how we don't put quotes around the variable's name. We put quotes around words that don't have any meaning to the computer, however variable names do have meaning.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The "+" symbol here combines the "Hello" with the variable "myname".</p>

<p>Now, change the message to greet Thomas instead.</p>


<script>
lessonEditorPayloads.variables1 = "var myname = \"Kate\"\nconsole.log(\"Hello \" + myname);\n";

var matchToAdvance = new RegExp(/Hello Thomas/i);
var matchMode = "output"; // either editor or output
</script>
