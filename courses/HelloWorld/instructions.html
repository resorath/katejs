<h1>Hello World!</h1>

<p>Computers tell people things in a variety of ways. One way is to write text to the screen.</p>

<p>In JavaScript, we can write text to the screen with <span class="code">print</span></p>

<p>Here is an example:</p>

<editor editor-id="home1" :content="lessonEditorPayloads.helloworld1" disable noloadbutton autoheight></editor>

<p>This time, try typing in the code yourself into the editor window below. Press "Run" when your ready.</p>


<script>
lessonEditorPayloads.helloworld1 = "print(\"Hello World!\");";

var matchToAdvance = new RegExp(/hello world/i);
var matchMode = "output"; // either editor or output
</script>
