<h1>Greetings</h1>

<p>A big part of programming is interacting with people. The person using our code is usually called the "user".</p>

<p>The example "Hello Thomas" from the last lesson is pre-loaded for you, but lets make it more interesting. We are going to ask the user for their name. We can do it like this.</p>

<editor editor-id="greetings1" :content="lessonEditorPayloads.greetings1" noloadbutton autoheight></editor>

<p>This line will ask the user for their name. Change the code in the editor so it writes the user's name to the screen.</p>

<script>
lessonEditorPayloads.greetings1 = "var myname = prompt(\"What is your name?\");";


var matchMode = "custom"; // either editor or output (or custom)

var matchToAdvance = function() {

	var matchEditor = new RegExp(/prompt/i);
	var matchOutput = new RegExp(/Hello [\S ]+/i);
	if(matchEditor.test(editor.getValue()) && matchOutput.test($('#output').html()))
			return true;
	return false;
}

</script>
