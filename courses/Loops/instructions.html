<h1>Loops</h1>

<p>Loops allow us to run the same code over and over again. A loop can be thought of as a <span class="code">if statement</span> that runs again, as long as it is true.</p>

<p>There are different styles of loops, here is a simple one called <span class="code">while</span>:</p>

<editor editor-id="loops1" :content="lessonEditorPayloads.loops1"></editor>

<p>Press "Copy into editor", then "Run" to see what happens.</p>

<p>Line 2 of the above code can be read as: "while variable counter is less than or equal to 5, run the code inside the curley braces again". The loop repeats until counter is not less than or equal to 5.</p>

<p class="exercise">Make the while loop run 10 times instead of 5:</p>

<script>
lessonEditorPayloads.loops1 = "var counter = 1;\nwhile(counter <= 5)\n{\n\tprint(\"Counter is \" + counter);\n\tcounter = counter + 1;\n}";

var matchMode = "callback"; // editor, output, or callback
var matchToAdvance = function() {
	var t = new RegExp(/while\(counter <= 10\)/i);
	var e = editor.getValue().replace(/\n|\r|\t/g, '');

	return t.test(e);
}
</script>
