<h1>If...Else If...Else</h1>

<p>We can expand the logic of <span class="code">if</span> and <span class="code">else</span> to as many conditions as we want to check. We can do this with <span class="code">else if</span>:</p>

<editor editor-id="ifelseifelse1" :content="lessonEditorPayloads.ifelseifelse1" autoheight></editor>

<p>You can change the current hour of day to see a different greeting.</p>

<p>We can see that if the first <span class="code">if</span> is not true, the <span class="code">else if</span> is checked to see if it's true. If neither are true, the <span class="code">else</span> block code is used.</p>

<p>You can have as many <span class="code">else if</span> statements that you want. Each one comes with it's own curly braces.</p>

<p>Write some code that greets different family members as "Hello Uncle", "Hello Mom", or "Hello Dad" based on their first name. Use any names that you want. Here is some sample code to get you started:</p>

<editor editor-id="ifelseifelse2" :content="lessonEditorPayloads.ifelseifelse2" autoheight></editor>

<p><strong>Hint: </strong>Use the <span class="code">==</span> to say if one String is equal to another.</p>

<p><strong>Hint: </strong>You don't need an <span class="code">else</span> statement if you don't need one.</p>
