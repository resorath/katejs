<h1>Numbers</h1>

<p>There are many types of variables. So far we've seen Strings.</p>

<p>Numbers are another type, they used without quotes:</p>

<editor editor-id="numbers1" :content="lessonEditorPayloads.numbers1"  disable noloadbutton autoheight></editor>

<p>Numbers are more interesting than Strings because we can do arithmetic on them. For example, add two numbers together. Try this out:</p>

<editor editor-id="numbers2" :content="lessonEditorPayloads.numbers2"></editor>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> for numbers, using <span class="code">+</span> adds the numbers together. For Strings, it simply puts the two strings side by side (called <em>concatenation</em>).</p>

<p>You can also add numbers to variables, or variables to other variables:

<editor editor-id="numbers3" :content="lessonEditorPayloads.numbers3"></editor>

<p>Try creating your own calculator that adds two numbers together that are found in <em>firstnumber</em> and <em>secondnumber</em>. Here is some sample code to get you started (press "Copy into editor", and then add your own code below it).</p>

<p><strong>Hint: </strong> you might need to create another variable to hold the total, and a print statement to show it.</p>

<editor editor-id="numbers4" :content="lessonEditorPayloads.numbers4"></editor>

<script>
lessonEditorPayloads.numbers1 = "var myage = 14;";
lessonEditorPayloads.numbers2 = "var myage = 14 + 1;\nprint(\"Next year I will be \" + myage + \" years old.\");";
lessonEditorPayloads.numbers3 = "var myage = 14;\nvar myagenextyear = myage + 1;\nprint(\"Next year I will be \" + myagenextyear + \" years old.\");";
lessonEditorPayloads.numbers4 = "var firstnumber = 5;\nvar secondnumber = 8;\n";

var matchMode = "callback"; // editor, output, or callback
var matchToAdvance = function() {

	if(typeof firstnumber != "number" || typeof secondnumber != "number")
		return false;

	var matchEditor = new RegExp(/var firstnumber[\S ]+\nvar secondnumber[\S ]+\n[\n[\S ]*print/i);
	if(matchEditor.test(editor.getValue()) && ($('#output').html().indexOf(String(firstnumber + secondnumber)) > -1) )
			return true;
	return false;
}
</script>
